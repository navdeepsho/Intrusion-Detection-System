Intrusion-Detection-System
IDS monitors a network or systems for malicious activity and protects a computer network from unauthorized access from users,including perhaps insider. The motive of this study is to propose a predictive model (i.e. a classifier) capable of distinguishing between 'bad connections' (intrusions/attacks) and a 'good (normal) connections' after applying some feature extraction on KDD Cup 1999 dataset by DARPA.
